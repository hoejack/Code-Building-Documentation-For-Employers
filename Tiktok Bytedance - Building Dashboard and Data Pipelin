Problem and Challenges 
- Team lead requested to track vendor's escalation from several tracker files while we always lost track with the count
- Team needs to calculate our review productivity on different review queues by day and by month basis. Have been manually calculated before I joined the company.

Action
- Build new productivity dashboard that auto calculates the total reviewed cases by person name and date. 
- Teammates will just need to enter their name and month/day and dashboard will do the entire calculation
- Using ImportRange function to track vendor's escalation file and auto-calculates the escalation (Full automation)
(Some info has been slightly modified as it involves employer's intellectual asset)

--------------------------------------

Several Codes Built for the Dashboard
=IF(ISBLANK(A11), 0, SUM(COUNTIFS('XXX Company ImportRange'!$A$3:$A$7000, Â A11, 'XXX Company ImportRange'!$B$3:$B$7000, C11), COUNTIFS('YYY Company ImportRange'!$A$3:$A$8200, A11, 'YYY Company ImportRange'!$B$3:$B$8200, C11)))
This code extracts all escalation information from other's company into our docs and auto-calculates the numbers of escalation based on certain condition (using COUNTIFS to count cases by name and by date)

=SUMIFS(N5:N2000, $B$5:$B$2000, $B$2, $A$5:$A$2000, $B$1)
Basic SUM calculation for certain conditions

=IF(ISBLANK(C13), "", MONTH(C13))
Change Datetime object to Month only to perform Monthly Calculation
